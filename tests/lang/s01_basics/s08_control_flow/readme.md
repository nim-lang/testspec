Language elements that can affect control flow of the code execution.

- `break`
- `if`
- `while`
- `case`
- `return`, `try/except/finally` and general procedure calls. Note - this
  section only specifies how control flow is transferred between bodies of
  the functions - everything related to the procedures themselves (argument
  passing, returning values, generic procedures and so on) is documented in
  the "core" section of the specification.

For statement is not specified since it's behavior heavily depends on the
implementation of a specific iterator that has been used.
